# M2R-Project
Compulsory group project done in 2nd year. Aim of my group (whose members arelisted below) was to study stochastic processes and their applications. Began by studying simple random walks and geometric Brownian motion. Then discussed the Black-Scholes equation and Black-Scholes model and its application to finance. Finished by discussing the extension of calculus to stochastic processes.


### Supervisor

[Dr. Andreas Sojmark](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.sojmark)

### Group members

• Yongda Zhu: (Section 1.1)

• Zhuohan Yang: (Subsections 1.2.1,1.2.2)

• Munazza Sarwar: (Section 2.1)

• Timothy Minn Kang: (Subsections 1.2.3,3.1.1,3.1.2, Section 2.2)

• Arthur Limoge: (Subsection 3.1.3, Section 3.2)

NB. Whilst each member of the group focused on particular subsections or sections, we all to each subsection/section as well.

### Datasets (I used)

• DB.csv -> Deutsche Bank stock prices (per day) from 12/06/2019 to 12/06/2020 -source: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DB/history?p=DB

• Final_DB_results.csv -> Deutsche Bank stock prices (at close of trading), times between 26/05/2020 and 12/06/2020 inclusive, call option prices - source: https://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=DB%23F1920E950000&insttype=&freq=1&show=&time=4 (call option prices) (time and stock prices obtained from DB.csv)

### Code (I created)

• Python Code for Figs 1 and 2 -> used to create Figures 1 and 2 in written report

• Black-Scholes Difference Plotter Deutsche Bank -> used to create Figure 3 in written report

### Code (to which I contributed)

• Variance_Ratio_test.R -> created by Arthur Limoge with help from Munazzar Sarwar and Timothy Kang

### Written Report

• M2R_Project_Report.pdf

All other datasets or code created by the group (even if not used in the final written report) can be found at https://github.com/ArthurLimoge/M2R-Research-Project-Stochastic-Processes-Finance
