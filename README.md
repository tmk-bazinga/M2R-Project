# M2R-Project
Compulsory group project done in 2nd year. Aim of my group (whose members arelisted below) was to study stochastic processes and their applications. Began by studying simple random walks and geometric Brownian motion. Then discussed the Black-Scholes equation and Black-Scholes model and its application to finance. Finished by discussing the extension of calculus to stochastic processes.
